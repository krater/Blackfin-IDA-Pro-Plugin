~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   You need the IDA Pro SDK to compile the processor module.

   Copy the files to sdk/module/blackfin, open the Visual Studio 6
   project files and start build. 
   Copy Release/blackfin.w32 to procs, blackfin.cfg to cfg and
   Release/rigol_ldr.ldw to loaders in your IDA folder.

   Sorry, at the moment only a visual Studio 6 project file exists.
   There is a additional Makefile that is a startpoint to compile with another
   compiler.


why
~~~
   
   I'm interested in reverse engineering the Rigol 1052E Oscilloscopes firmware
   for hacks and homebrew. So there i developed a tool to do that...

   If you have any informations for me, feel free to contact me.

     - Function frame sizes are sometimes wrong
     - Add known function starts/ends
     - Some coloring things
     - LOOP has no references
